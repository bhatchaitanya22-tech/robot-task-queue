# Robot Task Queue & State Simulation

This project simulates a robot executing tasks sequentially using a task queue. Each task has a defined time and state, demonstrating basic task scheduling and state transitions for robotics automation.

## Features
- Sequential task execution
- Robot state tracking
- Total execution time calculation
- Logs task states for analysis

## How to Run
```bash
python task_queue_sim.py
